# Day-1-of-100

100 Days of Coding Challenge - Day 1
🚀 Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Journey! 🚀
📝 Overview
In 2025, I made a New Year’s resolution to take my programming skills to the next level by challenging myself with 100 Days of Coding. This challenge is an exciting journey where I will solve coding problems every day, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics.

I’ll be documenting my progress here and sharing my code along the way. Each day will focus on learning a new concept, implementing it, and building a solid foundation in programming.

💡 What I Will Learn
Programming fundamentals
Problem-solving techniques
Data Structures & Algorithms
Code optimization
Building confidence in Python and other tools
📚 Day 1: Learning the Basics
What I learned today:

Setting up Python and VS Code as the IDE
Executing basic Python code
Understanding variables, data types, input/output operations, and operators
Writing basic Python programs to solve real-world problems
🧑‍💻 Problems Solved on Day 1
Swapping Two Numbers
Swapping two numbers without using a third variable.

Simple Interest Calculator
Calculating simple interest using the formula: SI = (P * R * T) / 100

Number Guessing Game
A fun number guessing game where the user tries to guess a predefined number.

Find the Largest of Three Numbers
Given three numbers, find and print the largest one.

Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Checking whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator.

Factorial of a Number
Writing a program to calculate the factorial of a number using loops.

Count the Number of Digits in a Number
Counting the digits in a given number by converting it to a string.

Reverse a Number
Reversing the digits of a number.

Sum of Digits of a Number
Calculating the sum of digits of a number using loops.

💻 Technologies Used
Python
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
📅 Plan for the Next 100 Days
I plan to keep building on my foundation by solving problems of varying difficulty each day. As I progress, I’ll dive deeper into topics such as:

Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Web Development with Python (Flask/Django)
Exploring new tools and frameworks!
🌱 How to Follow Along
You can follow my daily progress in the Issues section of this repo, where I'll be documenting each day’s problem and solution. Additionally, I’ll be posting my journey on LinkedIn to share insights and engage with others who are also learning and growing!
